&lt;p&gt;after years of providing our good old &lt;a href="https://qwebirc.org/"&gt;qwebirc&lt;/a&gt; based webchat,
we are excited to announce that freenode is moving to a new &lt;a href="https://kiwiirc.com/"&gt;Kiwi IRC&lt;/a&gt;
based solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change will occur during this weekend (June 22nd / 23rd).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Fuchs, ilbelkyr</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 20:42:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>ircd-seven 1.1.8</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/seven-118.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're preparing to release version 1.1.8 of ircd-seven and deploy it to the
production network over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release incorporates a number of user-facing changes:&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 10:15:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode Next Gen Tor Hidden Service</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/torv3.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the Tor Project has developed a &lt;a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/NextGenOnions"&gt;new Tor Hidden
Services protocol&lt;/a&gt;.
It has a few improvements over the previous version, including better
cryptography using SHA3 and ed25519.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've added a new Tor Hidden Service address to &lt;a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat#accessing-freenode-via-tor"&gt;our instructions for connecting
to freenode via Tor&lt;/a&gt;
that uses the new protocol. The new address is&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">dax</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode #live 2018 is a wrap, thank YOU!</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/live-2018.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. What an incredible weekend. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all those who joined us for freenode #live this weekend. Whether you participated in person or tuned into the livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were fortunate enough to have an exceptionally inspiring and engaging speaker line-up - thank you so much for coming to inspire the community. Thank you also to our supportive sponsors who have enabled us to put this event on again, and of course the freenode volunteer team - both those who detached for a weekend to throw themselves into an entirely different type of volunteering and those who stayed behind to keep the network running and also doubled as livestream monitors, a special thank you to you all for your willingness to adapt and get stuck in. A huge thank you also to the venue staff, and to the AV technicians! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU are freenode.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2018 22:59:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Did you hear? freenode #live is coming to town!</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/live.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A little over a month from now, the second freenode #live will take place at We The Curious in Bristol. With talks from many free and open source community leaders such as Leslie Hawthorn, VM Brasseur, Chris Lamb and Bradley Kuhn, freenode #live once again brings an international free software gathering to the South West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other exhibitors at this yearâ€™s event will be the returning main sponsor, &lt;a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/freend/"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Free Software Foundation, OpenSuSE, Minetest, Linux Journal and the Handshake Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; is a new decentralized alternative DNS root, and for a short time before launch freenode users and members of the free and open source community are encouraged to sign up today at Handshake.org and receive free Handshake coins that can be used to purchase domain names when Handshake launches in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mattl from Handshake</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 16:47:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spam filtering</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/spamfilter.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you are aware, we've been experiencing significant spam over the
past few weeks. As a result, we have decided to roll out a server-side spam
filter. Unlike our current spam-mitigating techniques, this system applies to
private messages and does not let the first matching line get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various ethical concerns have been raised over the course of introducing this
feature. They'll be addressed below. The short version, though, is that the
system has various limitations built in designed to prevent operator abuse.
Only a tiny bit of information can get out of the filters, and they do not have
access to much information themselves, to the extent that we believe the
obvious ways to abuse such a feature are impractical.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:47:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Continued and persistent spambot attack and clarification</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware there has been a prolonged spambot attack directed at freenode (and other IRC networks) in recent weeks, targeting a number of individuals involved with freenode and the wider IRC communities. The freenode team, and people involved with the wider IRC communities, are working hard to mitigate and reduce the spam that hits your community channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam content has changed in the last few days and while I am extremely glad that the attacks appear to no longer focus on members of the volunteer team and no longer involve libellous and false statements relating to these volunteers, we feel we should provide some clarification on some of the claims that are being made in the current spamwave relating to freenode and its involvement in Handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current spambot attacks state that freenode is involved with an 'ICO scam' relating to the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; project. Most freenode volunteers have involvement with one or several FOSS projects, often projects that use the freenode network as part of their communications toolbox. Handshake is no different in this regard, as it is a project that I have been involved with. I am deeply sorry to those affected by the spam, to freenode and to Handshake that spammers have chosen to use my involvement as a further platform to attack the freenode communities, and now also Handshake. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Current spambot attack on freenode (and elsewhere)</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/spambot-attack.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Many of you will have noticed that over the last few days there has been an extensive spambot wave on freenode, and on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fairly aggressive spambot attacks link to websites that we believe to have been set up to impersonate freenode volunteers, and that we believe to contain offensive and incorrect information intended to defame and libel members of the freenode volunteer team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the matter has been escalated to law enforcement and both the project and the individual volunteers concerned have sought legal advice in connection with the current attack. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2018 13:20:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode #live 2018: Welcoming (some of) this year's keynote speakers</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-live-keynotes.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is with a great deal of excitement that I can announce some of this year's keynote speakers for freenode #live. The entire freenode team is excited to be welcoming the following FOSS rockstars to Bristol this November; Bradley Kuhn, Chris Lamb, Kyle Rankin, Leslie Hawthorn and VM Brasseur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a few more exciting announcements to make in the lead-up to the conference! You don't want to miss out, and we encourage you to head over to https://freenode.live to get your tickets for this year's event! And if you want to join this year's speaker line-up then you still have some time, the CFP is open and we're looking forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 13:49:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode Security Update: Reused Password Attack</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/security-update-rpa.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the very early hours of today (Friday 29 June 2018), we became aware of unauthorised attempts to access a substantial number of freenode accounts. This appears to be the result of an attacker using lists of usernames and passwords from other online services that have previously been compromised, and trying these combinations on freenode accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our investigations commenced immediately and we found that the attacker had been able to log in to a number of freenode accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode has not been hacked or compromised.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 08:08:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode and irc.com</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-irccom.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In light of the two ongoing threads on &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17375831"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/8t2wcq/irccom_acquired_by_london_trust_media_plans_for_a/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; concerning LTMH and irc.com, we have had a fair few freenode users contact us with questions as to whether irc.com will replace and/or absorb freenode, and what impact it would have on freenode communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure that I addressed these concerns, and I can assure you that there are no plans on the part of freenode or LTM that involve any changes to freenode, freenode is not on the brink of shutdown â€” if anything, we are excited to be celebrating our 20th anniversary at this year's &lt;a href="https://freenode.live"&gt;freenode #live&lt;/a&gt; event, and we hope to see at least another 20 after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freenode project exists to support the development and use of Free and Open Source Software, and to that end it serves a very different purpose to the one that the visionaries behind irc.com have in mind. I fully believe that freenode and irc.com can co-exist, just as we co-exist with the numerous other IRC networks out there, and I would like to hope that irc.com may encourage those of their users who would be a good fit for freenode to come check us out, just as I hope that we may be able to send someone their way should we come across users who have great potential for running a series of training sessions or similar.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2018 21:20:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Announcement: jobs.freenode.net - New Service</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/jobs-freenode.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, we have found that a variety of freenode community members have reached out to us when they have been involved in the hiring process at their places of work. We have always been keen to support and promote relevant topics within the wider freenode communities, and we are excited to be launching the new &lt;a href="https://jobs.freenode.net"&gt;jobs.freenode.net&lt;/a&gt; website. Whether you are hiring for a permanent full-time role, looking to fill a temporary contract or looking to attract volunteer contributors for your FOSS project, we very much welcome and encourage you to use the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that the new site will provide a useful addition to the existing freenode projects, such as the IRC network and the &lt;a href="https://freenode.live"&gt;#live&lt;/a&gt; conference. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 09:24:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Services maintenance and password security</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/services-maintenance-password-security.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We recently took our services (NickServ and friends) offline for maintenance to
ensure encrypted storage of the services database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, we accidentally started services with an empty database.
While we quickly realized the mistake, a large number of users were already
logged out before we stopped the process, receiving a message like "Account
&lt;em&gt;youruser&lt;/em&gt; dropped, forcing logout". Services were quickly restored to normal
afterwards and people were able to log in to their accounts as before. We would
like to apologize for the disruption and confusion this may have caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some people have used this opportunity to spread some
misinformation, claiming that "all passwords have been released". This is not
the case; there has been no threat to account security due to this incident.
Additionally, we do not store passwords in a recoverable form at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">ilbelkyr</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2018 17:12:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Updated Privacy Policy</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/updated-privacy.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With GDPR coming into effect tomorrow, 25 May 2018, freenode has made some amendments to its privacy policy to provide clarification relating to GDPR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event that you do not consent to our continued processing of your personal data in order to provide you with access to the service, you may drop your nickserv registration using the drop command (please see '/msg nickserv help drop' for further instructions).
The latest version of our policies can always be found &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/policies"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 23:58:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Channel moderation and channel topics</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/topic-lock.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On freenode, we have always tried to minimise the amount of policies we apply across the network to allow projects to run their project channels in ways that complement their wider procedures and code of conducts for the projects both on and outside of IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, a number of project channels opt to run their channels in a way that allows any user of the channel to modify the topic, and for most this is an approach that works most of the time, and ensures that updates can be announced and communicated effectively without all community members needing to be on the access list for the channel in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the trade-off is that also those outside of the community are able to join and modify topics at will, and we are currently finding that a number of a project channels are having their topics changed to a message encouraging the users of the channel to move to a different channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 07:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
